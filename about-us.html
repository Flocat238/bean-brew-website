                    <p><br>Hi!  We're Alex & Bailey! <br><br>
                        Welcome. We're really glad you're here. <br><br>This cafe started with just the two of us, a handmade coffee cart, and a big dream. 
                        Back then it was early mornings, lots of learning, and a lot of trial and error. Slowly (and with plenty of caffeine), that little cart grew into the space you see today.
                        </p>

                <div class = "about-us-text-2">
                    <p>We've created this cafe to be somewhere you can truly settle in. Whether you're opening your laptop to do some remote work at one of our big tables (don't worry, 
                        there are loads of plug sockets), meeting a friend for a catch up, or just enjoying a quiet coffee on your own, there's room for you here. On weekends, 
                        things get a bit livelier when our event space hosts live music, creative events, and community gatherings.
                        <br><br>
                        Good coffee really matters to us, but so does doing the right thing. We only use fairtrade coffee, sourced responsibly and brewed with care. Giving back is a big part of who 
                        we are too, and we're proud to work with our local foodbank to support our wider community whenever we can.

                    <p>More than anything, this place is about people. Everyone is welcome here - <b>exactly as they are</b>. Whether you are a regular, a first-time visitor, a remote worker, a freelancer, an artist, or just passing through, 
                        we hope you feel the warmth, intention, and heart that's been poured into this place from the very beginning. <br><br>Thank you for being part of our story.
